# Calculate Your Body Mass Index

The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator can be used to calculate BMI value and corresponding weight status while taking age into 
consideration. Use the "Metric Units" tab for the International System of Units or the "Other Units" tab to convert units into 
either US or metric units. Note that the calculator also computes the 
Ponderal Index in addition to BMI, both of which are discussed below in detail.
